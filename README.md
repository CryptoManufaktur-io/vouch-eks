## What is GCP Autopilot

* Autopilot is a managed Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that is designed to reduce the operational cost of managing clusters, optimize your clusters for production, and yield higher workload availability.

* Autopilot GKE provisions and manages the cluster's underlying infrastructure, including nodes and node pools, giving you an optimized cluster with a hands-off experience.

* GKE Autopilot can be enabled for your Kubernetes cluster by adding the variable 'enable_autopilot = true' to your GKE Terraform configuration.
